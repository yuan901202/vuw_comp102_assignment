Questions for reflection.
=========================

The NamePrinter program is pretty simple, but it still contains quite a lot of
different kinds of instructions. Even though we haven't covered them all in
lectures yet, you should still be able to make educated guesses about what they
mean.

1. Group the instructions in the code into several different categories.

(1)Keywords: public, class, void ...
(2)Identifiers: UI.printIn, UI.setColor, UI.clearGraphics ...
(3)Strings: and
(4)Numbers: 100, 70 ...
(5)Operators and punctuation: + - * / ; , ( ) { } [ ].

2. Can you guess at which elements of the instructions could be varied?

I think identifiers elements of the instructions could be varied.


The MazeMouse puzzle is trickier than it first looks, like lots of programming tasks.

1. What process did you go through to try to solve the puzzle?

I try to add or delete some black squares on the MazeMouse, then I try to fill the solutions with my methods.
However, when I change some black squares, and run the application without change my methods, it would not
working again. As a result, my methods only working on the first solution. So I try to another method, and it
worked well.

2. If you were trying to be systematic in checking that someone else's proposal
would work on any maze, how would you go about it?

I might be changing some solutions randomly,then run the application without changing method. Firstly, I
could be changing some solutions on the MazeMouse, then run it. If it is still can solving the puzzle, I
need repeat the first step, unless I found the way could not solve the puzzle or not. Finally, I will
checking that someone else's working methods again.
