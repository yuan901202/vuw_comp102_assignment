/** A PartyBalloon object represents a small round balloon on the graphics pane.
    It remembers its current position and its color.
    Its initial position and its color are set when it is constructed
    The diameter of a balloon should be 30.
    It has two methods:
      riseLeft(),  which makes the balloon rise up by 20, and move 5 to the left
      riseRight(), which makes the balloon rise up by 20, and move 5 to the right
    Both methods
      - erase the balloon from its current position, [UI.eraseOval(....)]
      - change the position,
      - redraw the balloon   [UI.fillOval(....)]
