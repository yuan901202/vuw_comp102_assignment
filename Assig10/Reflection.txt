Questions for Reflection: 
=========================


This was the last assignment for COMP102.  Think back to the beginning of the
course and what you knew at that point, and then list some of the new skills
and understanding that you believe that you have gained during this course.

[For some of you who knew a lot already, there may only have been a few new
things, but try to identify them].

[For some of you who are still finding the course difficult, you could
try doing some of the early assignments again; you may find them an awful lot
easier the second time round, demonstrating that you have learned stuff!]

I'm able to understand, design, and construct small programs using the Java programming
language and an object-oriented design approach when we end of the course.
I learned how to use Javascript to design website when I was study at Foundation Studies.
Some parts of Javascript is similar with Java, like array.
But large part of Java that I was learned this time is new to me.
For example:
1) UI methods -- predefined object
2) Graphical output -- draw/fill methods
3) Parameters -- limit method
4) Return values -- "this."
5) Creating objects -- "new"
6) Conditionals -- "if ... else" or "if ... else if ..."
7) Boolean value -- a value that is either true or false

8) Input method -- "next"

9) Files -- reading and writing from a file

10) Event-driven input -- user interface

11) Array, 2D array -- store information
