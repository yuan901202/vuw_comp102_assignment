Questions for reflection:
=========================

1. Though the syntactic structure of a while statement is simple, getting
   the details right can be tricky. 

 * Which loops did you have difficulty getting right?
 I find while loop is difficulty getting right in my code.
 
 * Explain where the difficulty was.
 I find I could not easily to define what should be in the while loop. 
 
 * Suggest two techniques that you think might help you test a program
   with a loop to help find and remove all the bugs. 
(1)Put a list of variables and then compare with demo pragram.
(2)Try to put different variables, such as numbers and words. Check the program can or cannot define the different varibales.
   
2. What are the additional concepts about programming and about Java that you
   have learned this week?   
 * Copy the concepts you listed in last week's Reflection,  fixing up any of
   the descriptions if you have a better understanding of them now 
 * Add the new concepts you have acquired this week, along with one sentence
   descriptions of them. 

   Last week's reflection:
   We use parameters to make program better and easily to understand. The parameters should be different depends on different situation. In addition, we also need define "printf()" before the argument. We also learned "this" that means the object that the current method was called on. We also learned returning values, and the value must be of the right type.
   The most important thing we learned that how to create new object. The object is no data, just actions.
   
   This week's reflection:
   This week I learned how to use while loop to make user continue input a list of variables. And I learned how to stop while loop by using "next" methods. I also learned use "break" to gets out of the enclosing while loop. However, I find "break" is quite difficulty to check my method correct. Otherwise, "break" must use "while (true)" and only use in the middle of the loop. And it cannot use to "keep going condition." In addition, we use ".equalsIgnoreCase()" enter a specific word to stop go through the program.
   One significant method used in Java code is that use while loop to keep the pragram going next step.
